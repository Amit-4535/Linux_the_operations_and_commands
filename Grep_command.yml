some commands of the grep 

Case-insensitive search
grep -i "failed" logfile

Invert match (exclude pattern)
grep -v "INFO" logfile

Recursive search in subdirectories
grep -r "ERROR" /var/log/

Show line numbers
grep -n "error" app.log

Count matching lines
grep -c "ERROR" app.log

List only file names with matches
grep -l "TODO" *.py

List file names without matches
grep -L "TODO" *.py

Match whole words only
grep -w "fail" logfile

Show only the matched part (not the whole line)
grep -o "[0-9]\{3\}" file

Show N lines after the match
grep -A2 "ERROR" logfile

Show N lines before the match
grep -B2 "ERROR" logfile

Show N lines of context (before & after)
grep -C3 "ERROR" logfile

Use extended regex (like egrep)
`grep -E "ERROR

Below are some examples 

Simple String Search
grep "failed" /var/log/syslog
Finds all lines containing the word failed

Case-Insensitive Search
grep -i "error" application.log
Matches error, Error, ERROR, etc.

Excluding Lines
grep -v "INFO" app.log
Shows all lines except those containing INFO.

Counting Matches
grep -c "Timeout" server.log
Counts how many times Timeout appears.

Searching Multiple Files
grep -r "connection refused" /var/log/
Recursively search inside /var/log.

Match Whole Words
grep -w "fail" build.log
Matches fail but not failure.

Log Analysis
grep "ERROR" /var/log/nginx/error.log
grep -i "timeout" /var/log/app/*.log
grep -C3 "Exception" app.log

Monitoring & Alerting
Combine with wc (word count) to detect error spikes:
grep -c "CRITICAL" /var/log/app.log
If the count is high, it can trigger alerts.

Filtering ps or docker Output
ps aux | grep nginx
docker ps | grep webapp
Find running processes or containers.

CI/CD Pipelines
•  In Jenkins/GitHub Actions, you might grep build logs for “FAILED” or “SUCCESS”.
•  Example
if grep -q "BUILD FAILED" build.log; then
  exit 1
fi

Config Validation
grep -r "password" /etc/
Find files that contain sensitive words.

Networking Checks
netstat -tulnp | grep 8080
ss -tulnp | grep nginx
Check if a port is in use or if a service is running.

Finding TODO/FIXME in Code
grep -r "TODO" /opt/project/



Pro Tips
•	Combine with less for scrolling:
grep "ERROR" app.log | less

Combine with awk for advanced processing:
grep "ERROR" app.log | awk '{print $5}'

Use --color=auto to highlight matches:
grep --color=auto "ERROR" app.log
