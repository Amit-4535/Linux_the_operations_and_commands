megha
Shivansh
Step1st – I want to take the first initial of every name available inside the file
So the command should be –
Command -- cut -c1 names.txt
Output –

nana,nan,papa,soma,rama
and now the requirement is like I want to print the 2nd column in this file so the command should be – command -- cut -d, -f 2 data1     (here -d is used for delimeter  -f for feild)
it will give me the 2nd column output—

nan
step4th – oin this below file I want to change the , to a : this symbol –
file -- amit,nama,megha,mama
nana,nan,papa,soma,rama
so I can use the command –
command -- cut -d, -f 1- data1 --output-delimiter=":"
cut -d, -f 1- data1 --output-delimiter=" | " (we can use this too)
cut -d, -f 1- data1 --output-delimiter=" @ " (we can use this too)
cut -d, -f 1- data1 --output-delimiter=" -- " (we can use this too)
now it will give me the below output – (we can use this too)
amit:nama:megha:mama
nana:nan:papa:soma:rama
step 5th – this below command will give you the file list available inside in your directory—
ls -ltr | awk '{print $NF}'
